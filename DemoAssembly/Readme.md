## DemoAssembly

A simple managed .NET Assembly that pops a subprocess. Useful for a test payload, as it visually demonstrates that everything worked. Also prints the args.

The test function in **DemoAssemblyEXE** is ```DemoAssemblyEXE.Program.Main```.
The test function in **DemoAssemblyDLL** is ```DemoAssemblyDLL.Demo.Test```.
